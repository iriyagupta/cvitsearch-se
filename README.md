# OCR Search Engine

[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)



## Introduction

This is the source code for the developed OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Search Engine which is an attempt to make an Information Retrieval and Extraction (IRE) system that replicates the current state-of-the-art methods using the IRE and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. In this project we have tried to demonstrate the study of the methods that are being used for performing search and retrieval tasks. We also present the small descriptions of the functionalities supported in our system along with the statistics of the dataset. We use Indic-OCR developed at CVIT, for generating the text for the OCR Search Engine.
